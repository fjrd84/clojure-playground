# clojure-playground

Learning some cool new stuff with clojure! 

This is my personal playground repository. I'll add code and documentation here while I follow the book [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/).

## Installation

Download from ...nowhere yet.

## Using Leiningen

This app has been generated with the following command:

`lein new app app-name`


Let's use [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to run this thing...

- `lein run` Run it!
- `lein uberjar` Build a jar file
- `java -jar target/uberjar/clojure-noob-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

Using the REPL:

- `lein repl` Start it!

## While using EMACS

Run the function `M-x cider-jack-in RET` to start the REPL in a new window.
